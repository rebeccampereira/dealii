/**
 * This namespace provides a collection of functions for generating
 * triangulations for some basic geometries.
 *
 * Some of these functions receive a flag @p colorize (see
 * @ref GlossColorization "the glossary entry on colorization").
 * If this is set, parts of the boundary receive different
 * @ref GlossBoundaryIndicator "boundary indicators"
 * allowing them to be distinguished for the purpose of evaluating
 * different boundary conditions.
 *
 * If the domain is curved, each of the domain parts that should be
 * refined by following an appropriate Manifold description will
 * receive a different
 * @ref GlossManifoldIndicator "manifold indicator",
 * and the correct Manifold descriptor will be attached to
 * the Triangulation. Notice that if you later transform the
 * triangulation, you have to make sure you attach the correct new Manifold
 * to the triangulation.

   * everywhere else. For more information on this topic see

   * The
   * cell faces on the cylinder and surrounding shells have manifold ids of
   * $0$, while the cell volumes adjacent to the shells (or, if they do not
   * exist, the cylinder) have a manifold id of $1$. Put another way: this

   *
   * In particular, since TransfiniteInterpolationManifold interpolates

  /**
   * This function implements a boundary subgrid extraction.  Given a
   * <dim,spacedim>-Triangulation (the "volume mesh") the function extracts a
   * subset of its boundary (the "surface mesh").  The boundary to be
   * extracted is specified by a list of boundary_ids.  If none is specified
   * the whole boundary will be extracted. The function is used in step-38.
   *
   * The function also builds a mapping linking the cells on the surface mesh
   * to the corresponding faces on the volume one. This mapping is the return
   * value of the function.
   *
   * @note The function builds the surface mesh by creating a
   * @ref GlossCoarseMesh "coarse mesh"
   * from
   * the selected faces of the coarse cells of the volume mesh. It copies the
   * boundary indicators of these faces to the cells of the coarse surface
   * mesh. The surface mesh is then refined in the same way as the faces of
   * the volume mesh are. In order to ensure that the surface mesh has the
   * same vertices as the volume mesh, it is therefore important that you
   * assign appropriate boundary descriptions through
   * Triangulation::set_manifold() to the surface mesh object before calling
   * this function. If you don't, the refinement will happen under the
   * assumption that all faces are straight (i.e using the FlatManifold class)
   * rather than utilizing the Manifold object you may want to use to determine
   * the location of new vertices.
   *
   * @tparam MeshType A type that satisfies the requirements of the
   * @ref ConceptMeshType "MeshType concept".
   * The map that is returned will be between cell iterators pointing into the
   * container describing the surface mesh and face iterators of the volume
   * mesh container. If MeshType is DoFHandler or hp::DoFHandler, then the
   * function will re-build the triangulation underlying the second argument
   * and return a map between appropriate iterators into the MeshType
   * arguments. However, the function will not actually distribute degrees of
   * freedom on this newly created surface mesh.
   *
   * @tparam dim The dimension of the cells of the volume mesh. For example,
   * if dim==2, then the cells are quadrilaterals that either live in the
   * plane, or form a surface in a higher-dimensional space. The dimension of
   * the cells of the surface mesh is consequently dim-1.
   * @tparam spacedim The dimension of the space in which both the volume and
   * the surface mesh live.
   *
   * @param[in] volume_mesh A container of cells that define the volume mesh.
   * @param[out] surface_mesh A container whose associated triangulation will
   * be built to consist of the cells that correspond to the (selected portion
   * of) the boundary of the volume mesh.
   * @param[in] boundary_ids A list of boundary indicators denoting that
   * subset of faces of volume cells for which this function should extract
   * the surface mesh. If left at its default, i.e., if the set is empty, then
   * the function operates on <i>all</i> boundary faces.
   *
   * @return A map that for each cell of the surface mesh (key) returns an
   * iterator to the corresponding face of a cell of the volume mesh (value).
   * The keys include both active and non-active cells of the surface mesh.
   * The order of vertices of surface cells and the corresponding
   * volume faces may not match in order to ensure that each surface cell is
   * associated with an outward facing normal.
   * As a consequence, if you want to match quantities on the faces of the
   * domain cells and on the cells of the surface mesh, you may have to
   * translate between vertex locations or quadrature points.
   *
   * @note The algorithm outlined above assumes that all faces on higher
   * refinement levels always have exactly the same boundary indicator as
   * their parent face. Consequently, we can start with coarse level faces and
   * build the surface mesh based on that. It would not be very difficult to
   * extend the function to also copy boundary indicators from finer level
   * faces to their corresponding surface mesh cells, for example to
   * accommodate different geometry descriptions in the case of curved
   * boundaries (but this is not currently implemented).
   *
   * @note Since @p volume_mesh and @p surface_mesh have different spatial
   * dimensions no manifold objects are copied by this function: you must
   * attach new manifold objects to @p surface_mesh.
